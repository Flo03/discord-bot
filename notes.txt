This is just a file to track some project notes for myself, feel free to disregard.

Conversation Goal:

Easy:
    Given -> Input Text
>>    Judge Sentiment
      hold sentiment and respond accordinly...
      maybe write a few premade responses and figure out how to generate "similar" sentences

Harder:
Return -> Message
>>    1. Train to respond in plain english
        ::GAN Generative Adversarial Network - first option... kinda hard
        ::maybe look into existing solutions i.e. chatbots. then focus on translation
>>    2. Seperately train to translate a plain english sentence into Shakespeare
        ::Will probably need to look into GAN for this... maybe something else??
        :: hopefully something else
    3. Return translated message...


sample stuff from python
sample_roles = dict()
sample_roles["test1"] = {"embed": {
    "title": f'Role Reaction Testing',
    "description": 'Adding a react will add the role.\nRemoving your react will remove the role.'
}, "reacts": {'🍌': "banana", '🌯': "burrito"}}
sample_roles["test2"] = {"embed": {
    "title": f'Another reaction role!!!',
    "description": 'Adding a react will add the role.\nRemoving your react will remove the role.'
}, "reacts": {'🤠': "cowboy", '🩺': "doctor"}}
# need to convert each "embed" to discord.Embed with arguments
with open("roles.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(sample_roles, f)
